The LLM analysis consists of two studies: Study 4 is intended to be a replication study of Ostropolets et al (Ostropolets A, Hripcsak G, Husain SA, Richter L, Spotnitz M, Elhussein A, et al. Development and evaluation of a scalable alternative to chart review for phenotype case adjudication using standardized structured data from electronic health records. 2022. doi:10.1101/2022.12.27.22283944) using a selected phenotype (Type 1 Diaebetes). The original study used an eMERGE phenotype. The corresponding author provided direction to use Phenotype 499 from the OHDSI Phenotype Library.
                                                                                                              
Study 5 is an extension of taking the original KEEPER method using a comparable Type 1 Diabetes phenotype from another leading school of thought in Phenotype Development and Evaluation, the DARWIN EU(R) program.
