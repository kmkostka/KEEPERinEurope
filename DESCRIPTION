Description: This package instantiates clinical cohorts created and validated by two academic teams (Columbia Irving Medical and University of Oxford, Health Data Sciences). The package loads these cohorts and makes OHDSI-KEEPER profiles for the phenotypes and generates IncidencePrevalence data for each condition. The purpose of this package is to evaluate how KEEPER extends to non-US data.
